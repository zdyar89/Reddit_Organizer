0,I would recommend Wall Street by Charles Geisst...fascinating read about how corporations basically took over America
1,"I started learning React right at the time that hooks took off, and I looked at classes and state and all the cruft around it (bind, anyone?) and then looked at hooks and made the easiest decision of my life in learning that first. I am BAFFLED that anyone could find that easier. Only if you came from a language where that was natural... because if you didn’t, it’s certainly not."
2,Use javalin as backend for java... Thank me later...
3,Where I work we use Spring Boot REST API and Angular on front end.
4,"I’m currently conspiring to move a friend I’ve never met but have spent thousands of hours with online across the country and into our home to get him out of a horribly abusive household, mostly mental abuse, sometime physical. 
  
We’ve planned this for over two years and had to jump on it because his parents are about to start a guardianship case to strip away his rights as an adult. He is 20 years old and a very kind and talented person. 
  
He lives in a small town and his father is the local pastor, everyone knows who he is and have been instructed for years to report everything he does back to his parents. For example, he was locked in his room for 2 weeks and internet was shit off, phone taken away because someone saw him sending something out at the post office. 

He flies out tomorrow morning, and if they catch him it’s over because they will lie to the courts to remove his rights as an adult. I’m a pile of nerves right now. 

To add: We’ve waited over 2 years because we both wanted him to finish high school, I also didn’t have space until now as I’ve just purchased my first home.

Edit: We’ve talked online so much because he would join my discord while I streamed or just played games. He is not allowed to play video games

Update: Firstly, thank you to everyone that is showing support, which is just about all of you. It definitely is a morale boost I needed this morning. I certainly didn’t think my comment would get so much attention, I mostly posted because it helped me kind of calm down last night, I was darn near having my first ever panic attack, so it really wasn’t for fake internet points. Sorry to anyone sending DM’s, I’m just a bit too high strung right now to reply to everyone. Doing my best to try and stay as relaxed as I can. Which isn’t working yet lol
  
I was unable to get him a ride, no Uber, no Lyft, not even a taxi service in their area. Small town is small. Thanks to a a bit of luck and the kindness of his boyfriends father, they picked him up for the 1.5 hour trip to the airport. 
  
His parents now know what’s happening, they pieced it together within 10 minutes of getting picked up. My guess is someone in town called them when they saw him leaving. 
  
Flight leaves in 2.5 hours from now, will update again. I see that there are some skeptics in the comments, perfectly reasonable to wonder that. If all goes well I will post a pic once we make it home.
  
Update 2: he made it to the airport and is through security. Now he just has to twiddle his thumbs for 2.5 hours until his flight. Better early than late I’m this situation I suppose. Edit: flight is delayed by roughly another hour. Unfortunate, but a later connecting flight is available so it’s all good really

Update 3: nothing new to report, however he’s now looking at this thread while waiting. I really wanted him to see all the support in here

Yet another update: his flight has been delayed again by a little longer, however they should start boarding soon. Murphy’s law I suppose.

Update 4: Well, he's been in the air for a while now. I'm not a fan of counting chickens, but I think we're home free at this point. Just wanted to update y'all real quick, as I decided to have a little snooze once he boarded and I could finally relax. I won't be updating his layover and all that jazz, but I will definitely jump in to let you all know once we've picked him up and are safe and sound at home.

Update 5: he’s been in the air for his second and last leg of the journey for a couple hours now. Landing here at 10pm PST (about 2.5 hours away now). I imagine this will be the last update before we’re back at the house, I’m guessing around 11pm PST. I don’t see any issue with posting a pic for you all. You’re support has been overwhelming, even the skeptics have been very kind. It means a lot and you all helped me a great deal by giving me something to focus on during the more stressful times today. I rarely participate on reddit so this has been very cool, when I woke up this AM to so much activity it was a bit scary but I’m blown away by your positivity. Thank you all!

Big update: we made it! Just getting some food into our faces then I’ll snap a pic to share. It’s been a long 24 hours but we pulled it off. I think we’re all pretty beat at this point so we’re moving kinda slow

Edit 7/25/2019: for anyone looking, he’s been here for just under a month and everything is good. He’s all settled in and just started looking for work today. He’s got a lot to learn still thanks to his parents, but he’s picking it all up pretty well all things considered. I’m taking him out fishing this weekend so wish us luck"
5,"I love it especially this early in the Summer. 

What these dummies haven’t begun to realize yet, is previously most of us wanted to help them. We wanted all Americans to have an equal shot. 

Now?  Fuck em. 

They have purposely supported policy designed to attack blue states.  They froth at the mouth at rallies over the torture of children in concentration camps, they suppress and outright cheat in elections. 

You are dead to us. Piss off."

7,"I dislike when people say 'Russian trolls' because it makes it sound like some hacker group sitting in their basements messing with the world for fun. There is a very influential Russian book called [Foundations of Geopolitics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics) published in 1997 that outlines how to destabilize the West. It's practically a to do list for Putin. Some highlights from the book:

* The United Kingdom should be cut off from Europe.

* Ukraine should be annexed by Russia

* create ""geopolitical shocks"" within Turkey

* Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke ""Afro-American racists"". Russia should ""introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics"".


This isn't some hacker group, or trolls, or 'rouge' group. This is a coordinated intelligence attack carried out by the Russian government. We're at war, it's just with information not bullets."
8,The ESPN 30 for 30 podcast did a five part series on Bikram Yoga that was fascinating and disturbing.  Highly recommend.
